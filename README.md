# ocarina-official-repo
ocarina official repository. This if not the repo for ocarina itself (get ocarina here: https://github.com/StonyVista/ocarina)

Setting up your own repo:
Firstly, you'll need some way of keeping the files online. A github repo is a good place for this as it allows for easy issue reporting is something is configured badly. Now you'll need to create an apps directory. In this apps driectory you need individual folders with the names of the programs you want to link on your repository. For example if you wanted to host firefox (don't bother its already in the official one) you'd just need to create a folder called 'firefox'. At this point you should have a directory that looks like url/apps/appnamehere in thr appnamehere folder you need to create a file called app.ocarina-info. In this file you need three lines, these lines can be in any order. The names are: name, type and url. Name is the name of the app EG: Mozilla Firefox, right now, the only type supported is app installers so this has to be left as app-ins and finally the url is the location of the app installer on the web. This file can have any extension but it needs to be executable by the Windows command line so .exe or .msi is best. Look in a file on the official repo for the fromatting. Now just switch ocarina to your repo (documantation on ocarina's page (https://github.com/StonyVista/ocarina) and now you can just type 'ocarina get appnamehere' and ocarina will do its thing! (Yay!)
